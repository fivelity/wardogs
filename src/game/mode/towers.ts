/**
 * towers.ts — the two Control Towers (`CP_TOWER_A`/`CP_TOWER_B`, ObjIds `1001`/`2001`).
 *
 * Design: WARDOGS_DESIGN_BRIEF.md → Secondary Objective 1 ("Secure Concentric Towers") /
 * "✅ RESOLVED — CapturePoint A/B → Control Towers".
 * Each tower is capturable by any scoring faction and, per the brief, holds a preplaced
 * `StationaryEmplacementSpawner` for the controlling team (that spawner already exists in the
 * Godot scene at each tower's `CapturePoint_A_1`/`CapturePoint_B_1` location — this file does not
 * spawn it, only tracks capture state). Capturing a tower grants that team one "decryption
 * segment"; per the brief's threshold (`TOWER_DECRYPTION_SEGMENTS_REQUIRED`, currently 1 — i.e.
 * holding a tower counts immediately), once a team holds BOTH towers simultaneously, this file
 * calls `hotzone.ts`'s `lockDriftTarget()` with that tower pair's midpoint, locking the flag in
 * place until either tower is lost.
 *
 * Tower world positions are the fixed, already-placed CapturePoint coordinates from
 * `MP_Granite_MilitaryStorage_Portal-ModBuilderCustom0.spatial.json` (`CapturePoint_A_1` /
 * `CapturePoint_B_1`) — not derived from any `mod.*` getter, since these two points are static
 * level geometry, not runtime state.
 *
 * Symbols verified against `bf6-portal-mod-types@4.2.0/event-handler-signatures.d.ts`:
 * `OnCapturePointCaptured`, `OnCapturePointCapturing`, `OnCapturePointLost` (per BUILD_GUIDE.md §4).
